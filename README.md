I made this project for fun about the Duke Men's basketball team for my final project for one of my classes,
and I wanted to showcase my CSS, JS, and HTML skills through this project.

Here's the link to access the website: https://ar358.github.io/

Currently, the formatting I have for the website is only for desktops and laptops,
and I'm working on making it mobile friendly.

I made this project for fun about the Duke Men's basketball team for an open final project website for one of my classes.
As a huge fan of Duke basketball, I wanted to create a website for fans of all levels (casual, intermediate, and hardcore fans)
that would allow them to familiarize themselves with the players. 

Here's the link to access the website: https://ar358.github.io/

Currently, the formatting I have for the website is only for desktops and laptops,
and I'm working on making it mobile friendly.

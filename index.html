            <h1 class="header">About This Project </h1>
            
                <p class="homepage_text"> Many Duke students know about the Duke Men's basketball team, but a lot of fans have no idea who the new players are, which players have stayed, or what their role on the team is. This project is made so that every fan of Duke Basketball can become more familiar with the 2017-2018 team. The site is split into this main page describing what the project is about, a team roster page (highlighting the makeup of the starting lineup and who the players on the team are), and a player profile page for each player. 
                    
                Each player profile is broken into different sections which include a small profile card, a short biography of who the player is, their role on this year's team and their skills, a video either highlighting the player's skill or the player's personality, and a photo carousel consisting of photos of the player. Although each player will have his page, some players will have more information than others.

            <h1 class="header"> New Team Same Dream 6 Rings </h1>
             <p class="homepage_text"> As was the case in the 2016-2017 pre-season, Duke was ranked number one for the second year in a row by the AP poll in the preseason and is expected to go deep into the NCAA Tournament. Because Duke is again ranked number one, each opponent that Duke faces will bring their best game to try to bring Duke down. Although Duke has had a highly recruited class the past two years since they've won the NCAA Championship in 2015, those teams' potentials were capped due to injury. This year, however, everyone is healthy and the freshmen class is looking as good as ever. Anything less than championship number six will be considered a dissapointment for Duke.</p>
